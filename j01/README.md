<h2>Riding the B-Line</h2>
<hr>
<p>
I recently transferred to Chico State University from Butte Community College, and one of the things that changed is my travel time. While the time it takes to get from where I live to Chico State isn’t much longer than the one to Butte, there are some key differences. For one, Chico State charges for parking. The second is that there is no guarantee that you will even find a spot. Thus, I decided to take Butte County public transportation: the B-Line. My main goals were to know when the bus was arriving and to have reliable transportation to Chico State.
</p>
<p>
The B-Line has many bus routes that run through Butte County, but I needed one that goes from Gridley to Chico. I did some investigating and found that there is a bus stop about a mile from where I live. The route that stops there is called Route 32, which travels from Biggs to Gridley and stops in Chico. All I needed to do was make sure that I was at the bus stop on time or else risk being left behind.

The first time I planned to go on the B-Line, not only was the bus running late, but I missed it. The whole time I was anxious since the bus wasn’t at the stop at 6:51 a.m., which is when it was scheduled to arrive. As such, the B-Line website proved <b>useful</b>, due to two key features: real-time bus tracking, and a phone number to text that responds with your desired bus’s arrival time.</p>

<p>Using these features, I was able to track the bus that stops near my house, which was barely leaving Biggs. Not only was this <b>efficient</b>, since I did it all on my phone <em>while</em> at the stop, but it made me feel reassured that I would not miss the bus. I was wrong. Though I was at the stop, I was on the wrong side of the road. Consequently, the bus driver didn’t see me and drove to Chico without me. Later, I found out that there were <em>two</em> bus stops on that road: one for pick up (the one on the other side of the road), and one for drop off (the one I was standing at). Thinking back, it makes sense, but I feel that there should be a sign letting riders know which stop is the one for pick-up. This is one of the ways that the bus stop is not <b>error-tolerant</b>. In fact, I’ve seen a few people make the same mistake that I did, so I know that it wasn’t just me.
